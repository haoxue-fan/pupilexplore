            <h4>During this game, you will "gamble" by repeatedly selecting from 
                a choice of two slot machines. Slot machines can win or lose you 
                coins.</h4>
            <h4>One slot machine will, on average, deliver better outcomes than 
                the other. <b>Your goal, for every turn, is to select the better
                slot machine</b>.</h4> 
            <h4>The total number of coins you collect during this game is 
                proportional to the performance bonus (up to $5) you will 
                receive at the end.</h4>

            <h1>How to Play</h1>
            <h4>For simplicity, the slot machines are represented using boxes, 
                with either an "S" or "R" label in the center.</h4>
            <h4>A slot machine's label only indicates the variation in reward, 
                not which arm is better.</h4>

            <h4><b>"S" boxes</b> are your <b>"Safe" slot machines</b> that will
                give you the <b>same outcome</b> after every selection.</h4>
            <h4><b>"R" boxes</b> are your <b>"Risky" slot machines</b> that will
                give you <b>varying outcomes</b> after every 
                selection.</h4>
            <h4>Again, safe/risky is independent of how rewarding a machine is:
                a risky machine may deliver more coins on average than a safe 
                machine, and vice versa.</h4>
