# PRACTICE begin

## Start of the experiment

You will have to wait 5 to 6 seconds before the round can start. 

This waiting period is marked with a cross in + form. 

During this period please relax and look at the cross. 

When the waiting period ends the cross will change the orientation to x form.

#

When the cross changes the orientation to x the round is ready to begin. 

You have to look directly at the cross for 1 second, this will trigger presentation of the options.

#

This presentation part of the round will last for 5 seconds. 

Each option is represented with a symbol.

You cannot make a choice in this part, you should use it instead to think which option to choose. 

The options will disappear when the time runs out and the cross will appear in + form.

#

When the cross appears in + form the part of the round for making a choice is ready to begin. 

To start the choice part you will have to look directly at the + for 1 second.

#

It's time to make a choice!

You make a choice by looking at the option and pressing the SPACE key simultaneously. 

You have very short time to make the choice in the real task, 1.5 seconds. 

If you are late, you will lose some points!

This is just enough time to look at the wanted option and press the key. 

#

Now you wait for the reward to be displayed on the top of the chosen option. 

To maximize your earnings you will have to learn which symbol is the most rewarding one.

In these practice rounds we display random numbers instead of the rewards you will see in the real task.
