## Start of the experiment

In this experiment you will play a game with 140 rounds. In each round you choose between several options and in every round you will encounter the same options. 

You can think of each option as a bag of coins. Every time you choose an option you draw a coin from the bag. After you make a choice you will see the value of the coin you got. 

Press RIGHT arrow key to continue.

Each bag can differ in the average value of the coins in it. Some options are better than others and you can find that out only by choosing options and observing the points you get. Also, whenever you make a choice, additional coins will be put in the bags and so options' values might change over time.

Your goal is to make choices in each game to earn as many points as possible. The more points you earn, the more money you will receive for your participation.

Before you begin with the real task you will go through several practice rounds where you will find out how the interface works and learn how to make responses. The experimenter will assist you during these rounds.

You will not be able to go back to these instructions after this screen, so please reread the instructions if something is not clear. If you have any questions, please ask the experimenter now.
