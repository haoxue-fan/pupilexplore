# TRACKERCALIBRATION begin

Before you begin we first need to calibrate the eye tracking system. This will be managed by the researcher.

From now till the end of the game please try not to move your head within the chin rest. Moving the head after the calibration will severely affect the data we collect about eye movements.

Experimenter will start the calibration.
