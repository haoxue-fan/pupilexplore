## Start of the experiment

In this experiment you will play 2 games, with 60 rounds in each game. 

In each round you choose between several options. You can think of each option as a bag of coins. The coins are put in each bag before the game starts and every time you click an option you draw a coin from the bag. After each choice you will see the value of the coin you got. 

Each bag can differ in the average value of the coins in it, as well as how variable the values are. Some options are better than others and you can find that out only by choosing options and observing the points you get.

Your goal is to make choices in each game to earn as many points as possible. The more points you earn, the more money you will receive for your participation.

Each game comes with a different set of bags of coins and bags are randomly assigned between the options. You can think of bags in each game as having coins of different currency. This means that in each game you will have to learn the value of each option again. In the games you will encounter these currencies: kuna and lev. 

After you complete all games one of them will be chosen randomly and we will pay you for the performance in the randomly selected game. Thus, you should put as much effort as possible in each game.

Before each game starts we will tell you the exchange rate, how the game currency will be converted to pounds. If the game is selected at the end, that exchange rate will be used to pay you out.

Note that we have set the exchange rates so that equally good performance in each game would amount to approximately equal amount of money. Hence, if you have done equally well in all games, it does not matter which one will be chosen for paying you out.

Before you begin with the real task you will go through several practice rounds where you will find out how the interface works and learn how to make responses. The experimenter will assist you during these rounds.

You will not be able to go back to these instructions after this screen, so please reread the instructions if something is not clear. If you have any questions, please ask the experimenter now.
