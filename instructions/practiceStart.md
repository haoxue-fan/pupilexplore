# PRACTICESTART begin

Let's get some practice!

You will go through several practice rounds. The aim is to familiarise yourself with the interface and how to make responses within the time limit. 

In the first couple of rounds we will display instructions about each part of the round and we will increase the duration of the round so that you have time to follow the instructions. We will remove instructions in the last practice rounds and set the durations you will encounter in the real task.

The only difference from the real task is that here you will see random numbers instead of a real reward after you choose a certain option. Because these are practice rounds choices will not count in the earnings.

Please press the RIGHT arrow key to continue.
