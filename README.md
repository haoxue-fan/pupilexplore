# Pupil vs. Explore Code Repo

This repo contains exp code and data analysis code relevant to the Pupil vs. Explore project. 

Contributors: Haoxue, Taylor, Deshawn & Emily

Now contains:

1. Experiment code (exp_psychopy folder)
2. instruction (text + figure) (game_instructions folder)
3. Simulation code (simulation folder)

Before finishing data analysis, the exp data will be stored in the shared google drive
folder (ask Haoxue if you have trouble accessing it). After finishing data analysis, de-identified data will be posted on OSF. 

## Running Participants

The recommended method for running participants is to run `main.py` through psychopy (only version XXX has been tested).
