# Pupil vs. Explore Code Repo

This repo contains exp code and data analysis code for "Pupil encodes total
uncertainty uring exploration". The manuscript is published in Journal of
Cognitive Neuroscience at the following [doi](https://direct.mit.edu/jocn/article-abstract/doi/10.1162/jocn_a_02025/116595/Pupil-Size-Encodes-Uncertainty-during-Exploration?redirectedFrom=fulltext)

Contributors: Haoxue Fan, Taylor Burke, Deshawn Sambrano & Emily Dial

Now contains:

1. Experiment code (exp_psychopy folder)
2. instruction (text + figure) (game_instructions folder)
3. Simulation code (simulation folder)
4. Analysis code (code folder)
5. Data (data folder, placeholder - download data from osf)
6. Models (model folder, placeholder - download data from osf)

Data is stored on [OSF repo](https://osf.io/q795b/). Note that to run scripts in
the code folder, you will need to download data files from osf and put the data
folder and code folder under the same directory.

## Running Participants

The recommended method for running participants is to run `main.py` inside
psychopy coder (only version 2022.01.04 on Windows has been tested). You will
also need an updated version of pylink. 

For any questions, contact Haoxue (haoxue_fan@g.harvard.edu) (Apologies for
potential bug that still exist in the current script & code. I am always happy
to talk about this experiment and provide more materials, just email me!)
